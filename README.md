## 🤔 The Planning
I wanted to build something that'll help me learn react. I didn't want to do a tik-tac-toe, weather app or some chatbot. Did those in plain JavaScript and it felt boring to do it again. So I decided to create a text gallery most galleries I've seen are static and doesn't feel alive. Started with simple React and picking some anime's I loved a lot. Hovered over the anime to show a unique animation that represents it as well showing three characters that moves along with your mouse. Clicking a anime shows a mini-wiki of characters and each character shows three scenes for that character. May not be great on mobile or tables(desktops and laptops is where it shines). But I'm happy with the animations and the transitions turned out!

For the Solo leveling one I kind of want to joke around with that one, and that was just add Sung-Jin-Woo. Since most people who watch that anime only watch it for him, and honestly most people can't even remember anybody else besides him and his shadows.

## 😄 The After Thoughts
After finishing this, I felt like I should have focus on one anime instead of several anime's. I realize adding the scenes and placements for the text was taking way longer than I expected, I should have focus on one and made it big and add a unique animation to each character instead of doing what I did. If I had to remake this again in a different framework/library I would do that. In the end, the result was quite nice!
